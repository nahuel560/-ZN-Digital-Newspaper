Rather, it is because I have been waiting for decades for someone to invent a purely digital currency, a currency for online purchases that wasn\u2019t linked to a credit card. It was the killer app that no one ever figured out.\r\n\r\nThus when bitcoin first emerged, I had hoped that it would be The One. In \u201cDigital Gold,\u201d his book about bitcoin\u2019s origins, Nathaniel Popper quotes an email from Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency\u2019s mysterious and possibly apocryphal inventor, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on a new electronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignright quote-simple \">That\u2019s how all the early bitcoin enthusiasts thought of it\u00a0a currency, one that allowed consumers to buy things.<\/blockquote>\r\nThat\u2019s how all the early bitcoin enthusiasts thought of it \u2014 a currency, one that allowed consumers to buy things while sidestepping both the banking system and national governments. What the bitcoin bubble shows, however, is that bitcoin is just another e-currency failure. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\r\n\r\nI first began thinking about digital currency in the mid-1990s when I met a brilliant cryptographer and mathematician named David Chaum, who had invented what he called electronic cash, or e-cash. It did exactly what bitcoin purports to do \u2014 allow people to use virtual money, stored on their computer, to make purchases and send money to other people.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-311\" src=\"https:\/\/source.unsplash.com\/collection\/765150\/1280x851\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"851\" \/>\r\n\r\nChaum was way ahead of his time. He founded his company, DigiCash, five years before the creation of either Netscape, which popularized the browser, or Amazon. By 1998, DigiCash was bankrupt.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was the short-lived \u201cinformation wants to be free\u201d era. Napster, which was founded in 1999, used peer-to-peer technology that allowed music lovers to download songs illegally. Newspapers didn\u2019t have paywalls, and many people came to assume that news shouldn\u2019t cost anything. I saw my own children downloading music and even movies, and when I would tell them they were violating the law, they would tell me I didn\u2019t understand how the world worked in the internet age.\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignleft \">As e-commerce took hold, the only means of payment was a credit card.<\/blockquote>\r\nAs e-commerce took hold, the only means of payment was a credit card. It was a real commercial friction point: every time you wanted to buy something you had to fill out your credit card information, plus your billing address and, if it was different, your shipping address as well. And once you had done that, your information would be vulnerable to hackers.\u00a0Electronic currency could have solved both these problems. If my children had access to a digital currency \u2014 maybe their allowance! \u2014 Napster could have struck deals with the record companies and charged for songs. They would have happily paid. And e-cash would have made internet commerce pretty darn close to frictionless. By 2000, the chief executive of an internet bank was saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where the internet economy needs e-cash.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt never happened. Instead, entrepreneurs and companies created a series of workarounds, some better than others. The best-known was PayPal, which essentially accessed your bank or credit card account to make purchases or send money. Apple and Amazon have also made it much easier to pay for things; when I want to pay for my monthly Washington Post subscription, I hit the \u201cAmazon Pay\u201d button and it\u2019s done. Even so, we still spend an awful lot of time filling out credit card information when we want to buy something online.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-260 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/source.unsplash.com\/collection\/765150\/342x591\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"359\" \/>Meanwhile, every effort to come up with an electronic currency foundered. I remember one called Qpass and another called WebPay. In the early 2000s, e-gold emerged as a potential solution, until it turned out that it was being used primarily by criminals. In 2008, its founder pleaded guilty to money laundering.\r\n\r\nAccording to the website\u00a099bitcoins.com, there are 89 companies that claim to accept bitcoin as currency, including Subway, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology bookstore, and the Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas. But I can\u2019t imagine anyone actually using it to pay for something. Who would use bitcoin for a purchase when it might go up by $500 in the next 10 minutes? And who would accept bitcoin when it could go down by $500 in the next 10 minutes?\r\n\r\nWhatever the original intention, bitcoin has morphed into an asset whose only purpose is speculation. \u201cThere is simply no way to predict what it will be worth,\u201d said Pete Kight, a \u201cfintech\u201d (financial technology) investor who founded Checkfree in 1981. That is its fatal flaw as an electronic currency.\r\n\r\nOr, rather, that is one of them. The other flaw is the very quality that many of its adherents love most about it: It operates separately from the government\u2019s fiat currency. \u201cI call it the tyranny of brilliance,\u201d said Kight. \u201cWhen you work in fintech, you often see engineering genius get out of synch with what works in the real world.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the case of bitcoin, he said: \u201cThere is this thing called the Federal Reserve. Its first job is to protect the financial system of the United States. For a cryptocurrency to be successful, it has to work out with the Fed how it won\u2019t undermine the banking system.\u201d\r\n\r\nI can imagine that after the bubble bursts, bitcoin will continue to be traded. Maybe a few of the other cryptocurrencies will have similar trajectories (though most will dissolve into nothingness). I can see it reflecting the larger economy in some way, rising in certain environments and falling in others. In the best case, bitcoin might come to be seen as the digital equivalent of gold.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But we\u2019ll have to wait a little longer for an electronic currency that works.","single_menu":false}
