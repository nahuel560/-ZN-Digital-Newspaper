A few simple tweaks will leave you with a bedroom so dreamy you won't even want to fall asleep.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h3><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">1. A COMFORTABLE RUG<\/span><\/h3>\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x853\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3704 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x853\" alt=\"pexels-photo-48570\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nothing ruins a happy morning (or makes a crabby one worse) like stepping out of the bed onto a cold, hard floor. Do yourself a favor and make sure your first step into the day is cushy and comforting. Already have carpet in the bedroom? Consider layering a smaller rug by the bed, similar idea to this room by Adeeni Design Group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote-simple\">Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people. <cite>Steve Jobs<\/cite><\/blockquote>\r\n<h3>2. A THEME<\/h3>\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x960\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3705 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x960\" alt=\"pexels-photo-201278\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\nIt's the first thing a child will consider when putting together their first bedroom, but adults tend to shy away from decorative themes. But even when it's not Spiderman or Princess-powered, a theme can be a powerful unifying device, not to mention calming. In this Southhampton cottage bedroom designed by Timothy Whealon, stripes are used throughout to create a streamlined yet funky touch.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">3. THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF THROW PILLOWS<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/themes.tielabs.com\/jannah-house\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/21\/2016\/12\/pexels-photo-29778.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-3702\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/199x300\" alt=\"pexels-photo-29778\" width=\"144\" height=\"217\" \/><\/a>How to figure out this number: It should be enough pillows so that your bed looks sumptuous and inviting when properly made...yet not enough that getting <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">in<\/em> bed requires 10 minutes of excavating. The sweet spot is usually between 2-6, depending on the size of your bed. This example from designer Lindsey Coral Harper gets it <em data-redactor-tag=\"em\">just<\/em> right.\r\n\r\nThis room, designed by Robert Passal, has more than a couple. A good spot to sit down will serve you well when you're reading or need to have a conversation with your partner. It's also great for putting on shoes, or checking email so you can leave tech out of your bed.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">4. A PLACE TO SIT (THAT'S NOT THE BED)<\/span><\/h3>\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x889\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3709 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x889\" alt=\"pexels-photo-238268\" width=\"1280\" height=\"889\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n\r\nThis room, designed by Robert Passal, has more than a couple. A good spot to sit down will serve you well when you're reading or need to have a conversation with your partner. It's also great for putting on shoes, or checking email so you can leave tech out of your bed.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">5. NO TECH IN SIGHT<\/span><\/h3>\r\nAnd that goes for a television as well: It will keep you up later than necessary and consequently keep your minding churning longer before you can drift off to sleep. It's hard, especially in an increasingly-connected world, but if you leave your i-everything at the door you'll be happier. Another perk? More room for furniture and accessories you love.\r\n<blockquote class=\"aligncenter quote-simple \">\u00a0The bedroom is about sleeping. What do you need when you're sleeping? Not a smartphone. <cite>Aur\u00e9lien Gallet<\/cite><\/blockquote>\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">6. A COLLECTION OF THINGS YOU LOVE<\/span><\/h3>\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x853\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3701 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x853\" alt=\"inside-apartment-design-home\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be an entire \u00e9tag\u00e8re-full, as seen in this bedroom by LA-based designer Kelly Sutton, but a cluster of pieces that make you smile will go a long way in making a bedroom feel just right. Bonus: This is also a great way to incorporate pieces you've acquired over the years but can't quite figure out where to put them. Make sure they're in your line of sight upon waking up and their true purpose will be revealed: Making you happy.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">7. WELL-STOCKED NIGHTSTANDS<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignright quote-simple \">Elegant and calming photographs in this room. <cite>Ryan White<\/cite><\/blockquote>\r\nYes, a nightstand with all the necessities looks lovely, but that's not the only reason you see it so often in magazine spreads and on blogs. The combination of a carafe of water, a great book, a plant or flower, and lamp (seen here in a San Francisco bedroom designed by Lisa Gutow) is essentially a kit for pre-, post-, and interrupted-sleep comfort. So as you're putting your own \"kit\" together, don't feel like it has to be stunning to be perfect. The more idiosyncratic and \"you\" it feels, the better it will work and the more it wlll be a testament to your personal style.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: This photo shows just one nightstand, but for balance, make sure there's another one with appropriate creature comforts on the other side of the bed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">8. A GREAT MATTRESS<\/span><\/h3>\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x854\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3703 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/1280x854\" alt=\"pexels-photo-29907\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n\r\nYou could have every item on this list but your bedroom wouldn't be complete without a perfect mattress. After all, if you're not getting enough quality sleep, you can't fully appreciate a beautiful room. \"You want a mattress that keeps you cool and gives you great lumbar support,\" says Ron Rudzin, CEO of Saatva Mattress. And of course, one that looks great in your room. He recommends choosing a mattress- and foundation-height based not just on your bed frame and headboard, but also the height of your night tables and window sills.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">9. PHOTOGRAPHS \u2013 BUT NOT OF FAMILY<\/span><\/h3>\r\nYou should have as many family photos as you wish in other rooms in the house, but it's best to keep the bedroom's artwork less emotionally loaded. Elegant and calming photographs in this room by designer Ryan White evoke good feelings much like family snaps do, without reminding you of specific people while you're trying to fall asleep.\r\n<h3 class=\"listicle--item-title\"><span class=\"listicle--item-hed\">10. DRAMA!<\/span><\/h3>\r\nEven the brightest, most cheerful bedrooms need an element of dark, sexy glamour. This bedroom by Windsor Decorating and Design has them in spades: The moody wall paint, the theatrical chandelier, even an oversized gray headboard does the trick. But notice how clean lines and touches of white keep it from looking like a bordello: That balance is key. Stick with one or two dramatic pieces and you'll be golden."}
