Let them look at the beauty of the waters and the trees and flowers on earth. They will then begin to think, and to think is the beginning of a real education.\u201d\r\n<blockquote class=\"aligncenter quote-simple \">While increased emphasis is being placed on the importance of digital learning to prepare for the future of our society and career opportunities<\/blockquote>\r\nWhile increased emphasis is being placed on the importance of digital learning to prepare for the future of our society and career opportunities, a growing community is advocating for another educational paradigm\u2014one in which students disconnect from technology and immerse themselves in nature. Outdoor Education can be widely defined, but generally is a form of experiential organised learning that occurs in an outdoor setting and typically <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">involves<\/a> \u201cjourney-based experiences in which students participate in a variety of adventurous, memorable challenges.\u201d This style of learning has various benefits, from cultivating the relevant emotional intelligence needed for effective leadership, to developing the confidence and competence needed to persevere in stressful situations. Below we delve deeper into five of these benefits and provide examples, accounts, and research to illustrate them.\r\n<h3>Increased Motivation to Learn<\/h3>\r\nAlthough learning within the four walls of traditional classrooms has its uses, students can often become bored and primarily rely on extrinsic motivation to retain the content being delivered to them. When connecting education to\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignleft quote-simple \">The Effects of Environment-Based Education on Students\u2019 Achievement Motivation<\/blockquote>\r\nthe natural environment, students have context in which to place their learning, and the intrinsic motivation of teamwork and ecological preservation as fuel to increase their desire to study and engage with curriculum. In their <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">study<\/a> \u201cThe Effects of Environment-Based Education on Students\u2019 Achievement Motivation,\u201d researchers Julie Athman and Martha Monroe studied 400 9th-and-12th-grade students and found that motivation levels for environment-based education were higher than those in traditional classrooms.[\/padding]\r\n\r\n[tie_full_img]<a href=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/200x200\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4883\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/200x200\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" \/><\/a>[\/tie_full_img]\r\n\r\n[padding top=\"0\" bottom=\"0\" right=\"5%\" left=\"5%\"]Where does this increased sense of motivation come from? Simon Abramson is the Associate Director for <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">Wild Earth<\/a>, a non-profit in upstate New York that delivers outdoor education programs to young people and adults. He finds that their programs help to develop confidence and competence in students, which further fuels their learning. \u201cWe are using nature as a classroom, and students learn things such as \u2018which plants can you eat? How do you make a shelter that is dry and warm, using only sticks and leaves?\u2019 There is a confidence that comes from gaining those skills and realising \u2018I can take care of myself and find what I need.\u2019\u201d By making a connection between learning and the real world, students feel an increased drive to understand the content they are studying.\r\n\r\nAnother example of a program that makes learning relevant via outdoor and environmental education is <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">NYC Outward Bound<\/a>. In once case study, they have utilised the Gowanus Canal, which is located close to several of the schools where their program operates. In a Salon <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">article<\/a> titled \u201cOutdoor Learning: Education\u2019s Next Revolution?\u201d Carol Carpenter, the Communications Director for the organisation, explains: \u201cStudents learn about the canal\u2019s water quality in science class, about the sociological effects in the humanities classes, and about the canal\u2019s design in art class. We believe in field work, in getting out of the classroom and getting your hands dirty.\u201d\r\n<h3>Cultivation of Awareness<\/h3>\r\n<blockquote class=\"alignright quote-simple \">According to Louv, natural environments promote \u201cinvoluntary attention\u201d or \u201cfascination,\u201d which enables us to be more alert.<\/blockquote>\r\nAuthor and environmentalist Richard Louv published a book in 2011 titled <em>The Nature Principle<\/em>, in which he argues that outdoor learning works because it \u201cdemands better use of the senses.\u201d In an 18-month study of 800 military personnel, Louv <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">describes<\/a> how researchers determined that the best bomb-spotters were people who lived in rural environments and regularly engaged all of their senses. On the other hand, personnel who \u201cwere raised on Game Boys\u201d as children did not have the ability to detect nuances in their environment and were focused on the \u201cscreen rather than the whole surrounding.\u201d According to Louv, natural environments promote \u201cinvoluntary attention\u201d or \u201cfascination,\u201d which enables us to be more alert.\r\n\r\nSimon describes how this value is instilled in the educational approach at Wild Earth: \u201cAwareness is the core of how we teach; it\u2019s the how. We are literally getting into our senses out in the woods and teaching skills with awareness-expanding games using peripheral vision, sense of hearing, sense of intuition, etc. Ultimately what our students are learning is how to be in the forest so they can know what\u2019s happening on the other side of the hill even if they can\u2019t see the other side.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/jannah.tielabs.com\/jannah-academia\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/32\/2017\/02\/work-space-e1487832826384.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-4820 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/placehold.it\/200x200\" width=\"274\" height=\"416\" \/><\/a>As a society, in order to make the shift towards lasting sustainable development, we will need to change the way we live and work. This will require new ways of thinking and shifts in attitudes, so the more education can lend itself to this imperative the better. It requires us to learn new approaches and attitudes for efficient use of our planet\u2019s limited resources and get much better at thinking about, and acting on, the long-term consequences of our actions as well as local, national, and global consequences. As a pathway to develop this grander sense of awareness, Simon says that students \u201cbegin to see their own impact on the forest. When they enter the forest, the forest changes. We teach how to account for that and how to shift that by asking \u201cHow do you walk into the forest in a way that doesn\u2019t change everything in the woods?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDirect experience of the complex interdependence of life on Earth enables reinforcement of the link between cognitive and affective learning, providing a bridge to advanced understanding,\u201d says a report titled <a href=\"https:\/\/tielabs.com\">Taking Learning Outdoors<\/a> published by the Scottish Government. \u201cThis gives learners a real context to explore, understand, develop and apply the values of wisdom, compassion, integrity and justice.\u201d[\/padding]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"}
